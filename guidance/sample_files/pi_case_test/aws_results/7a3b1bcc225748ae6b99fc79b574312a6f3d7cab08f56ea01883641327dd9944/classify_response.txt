1. Review the document page-by-page:
   - Page 0: This appears to be a medical bill or patient statement, containing itemized charges, payment summary, and insurance information.
   - Page 1: This page contains a medical lien notice related to the patient's billing.

2. Group the pages together since they are sequential and related to the same document.

3. Identify the appropriate class for this document grouping. Based on the content, this appears to be a MEDICAL_BILLS document.
