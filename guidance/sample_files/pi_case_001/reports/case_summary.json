    "description": "On Friday, March 15, 2024, at approximately 1435 hours, I, PO Rodriguez, responded to the scene of a motor vehicle accident at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles in the northbound lane of Third Avenue. Vehicle 1, a blue 2021 Honda Accord operated by Maria Santos, was stopped at a red traffic signal facing northbound. Vehicle 2, a white 2019 Ford F-150 operated by Robert Thompson and owned by Johnson Delivery Services LLC, was traveling northbound behind Vehicle 1. Vehicle 2 failed to stop and struck the rear of Vehicle 1. Driver Thompson stated he did not see Vehicle 1 stopped. Two independent witnesses stated they observed Vehicle 2 strike Vehicle 1 without braking, and one witness stated the driver appeared to be looking down. EMS Unit 45 responded and transported Driver Santos to Bellevue Hospital for treatment of neck and back pain. Driver Thompson was issued a summons for VTL 1129(a) - Following Too Closely.",
