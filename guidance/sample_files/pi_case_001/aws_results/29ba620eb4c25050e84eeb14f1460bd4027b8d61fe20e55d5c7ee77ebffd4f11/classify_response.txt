To group and classify the document, I will review the document page-by-page and group the sequential pages from the same document together. Then, I will identify the appropriate class for each grouping based on the expected inputs for each class.

The document contains 2 pages, with page-index values of 0 and 1. The content of the document appears to be a police accident report, specifically an NYPD MV-104 form. It contains all the expected inputs for the POLICE_REPORT class, including the report number, date of accident, location, vehicle and driver information, and a narrative description of the accident.

Therefore, I will group the 2 pages together and classify them as a POLICE_REPORT.
