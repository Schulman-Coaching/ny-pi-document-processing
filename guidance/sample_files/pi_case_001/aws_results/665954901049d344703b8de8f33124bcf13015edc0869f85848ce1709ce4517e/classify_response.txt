To group the pages and classify the document, I will go through the following steps:

1. Review the document page-by-page and group sequential pages from the same document together.
2. For each grouping, identify the appropriate class from the list of classes provided.

The document has 2 pages, so I will group them together.

Reviewing the content of the pages, I can see that this is an auto insurance policy declarations document. The pages contain information about the policy, coverage limits, premiums, and compliance with New York state minimum requirements.

Based on the class descriptions, the appropriate class for this document is "INSURANCE_POLICY".
