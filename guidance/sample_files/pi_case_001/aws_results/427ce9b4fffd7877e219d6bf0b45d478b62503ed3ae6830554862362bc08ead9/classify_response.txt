To group the pages and classify the documents, I will:

1. Review each page and its content
2. Determine which class the page belongs to based on the expected inputs for each class
3. Group together sequential pages that belong to the same class
4. Return a JSON array with the class name and page indexes for each grouping

<json>
[
  {
    "class": "MEDICAL_BILLS",
    "page-indexes": [0, 1]
  }
]
</json>

<thinking>
Page 0 contains a patient billing statement from a hospital with itemized charges, CPT codes, and payment information. This matches the expected inputs for the MEDICAL_BILLS class.

Page 1 continues the billing statement with a medical lien notice, so it belongs to the same MEDICAL_BILLS document.

There are no other pages in this document, so the JSON array only contains one grouping for the MEDICAL_BILLS class with page indexes 0 and 1.
