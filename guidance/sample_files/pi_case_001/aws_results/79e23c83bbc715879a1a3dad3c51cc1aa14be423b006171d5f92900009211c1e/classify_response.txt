<thinking>
To group and classify the document pages, I will go through the document page-by-page and identify the appropriate class for each page based on the expected inputs for each class.

The document contains a police accident report, which includes the report number, date of accident, location, vehicle information, driver information, and a narrative. This matches the expected inputs for the POLICE_REPORT class.

The document does not contain any medical bills, bank statements, URLA 1003 forms, medical records, drivers licenses, or insurance policies, so those classes do not apply.

The document should be grouped into a single class, POLICE_REPORT, covering both pages.
