1. Review the document page-by-page:
   - Page 0: Contains an emergency department medical record
   - Page 1: Continuation of the emergency department medical record

2. Group the sequential pages from the same document together:
   - Pages 0 and 1 belong to the same document.

3. Identify the class for the document:
   - The document contains a medical record, so the appropriate class is "MEDICAL_RECORDS".
