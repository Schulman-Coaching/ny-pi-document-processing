<thinking>
First, I will review the document page-by-page and group the sequential pages from the same document together.

The document has 2 pages, so I will group them together.

Next, I will identify the class for this document grouping. Based on the content, this appears to be an insurance policy document, so the appropriate class is "INSURANCE_POLICY".

Therefore, the final JSON array will be:

<json>
[
{"class": "INSURANCE_POLICY", "page-indexes": [0, 1]}
]
</json>
